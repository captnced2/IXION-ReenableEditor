# Reenable Editor
[Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/ixion/mods/16)  
<br>
The Editor was already built into the game, I discovered it when coding mods. This mod simply enables it again with a few lines of code.  
The settings that you can change save automatically. 

Don't ask me what the settings do, I have no idea about most of them either but i'm pretty sure most of them are the exact same as the ones you can change at the start of the game.

# Installation
Simply download [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v6.0.0-pre.2) and extract it into your IXION ("\steamapps\common\IXION\") folder.  
Then download and put the latest release into the plugins ("\IXION\BepInEx\plugins\") folder.  
This mod **_requires_** the [IMHelper](https://github.com/captnced2/IXION-IMHelper/releases) mod see each release for the required version.

# How to use
Click the editor button to the left of the settings button in the top right corner.  
Change the values at will.
